## shorthands for arithmatic operators

```sh
return variable++
```
it will first return variable and then make changes.
# It is  same as
```sh
varible=+1;
```

# It is  same as
```sh
varible=+1;   
```
#NOTE: to understand just follow sequence of operators
it will perform operation in sequence of operators.
in above case it will copy the current value because of [=]
and then add because of [+]
